      <h4>Table Hopping</h4>
      <p>Whether you're waiting on food to arrive, or simply socialising around tables, I can come round the tables and do a wide variety of magic with your guests. It passes the time, brightens the mood, and provides a topic of conversation whilst you eat, and of course, i'll move on as the food arrives!</p>

      <h4>Small Stage Show</h4>
      <p>If theres a space in the proceedings that you don't quite know how to fill, I can do a short magic show which will grab everyones attention. Bringing members of your group up onto the stage, young or old will create laughter and will be a fun way to close any gaps in your schedule!</p>

      <h4>Group Magic</h4>
      <p>Going up to groups and showing magic to groups up close and personal is where I thrive. Magic is most impressive when it happens in your own hand or right in front of your eyes. I can provide all that and more when i'm performing to groups, and soon the group builds and builds, increasing interactions between guests and creating an experience the invitees will not forget!</p>
